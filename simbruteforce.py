# Define a Character Set
# Set a Max password length
# Implement a loop that iterates through all poss
# perms of chars within defined length using nested loops
# Generate password candidates inside loop use string manipulation
# or library functions to generate each possible combination of characters based on your chosen character set and length.
# Apply MD5 hashing (simulation)
# Check for matches-compare the sim hash (stored strings) with target hash
# Analyze results - once the loop finishes, analyze number of iterations
# to reach desired len or sim match which gives an idea of the sheer number of possiblilites
